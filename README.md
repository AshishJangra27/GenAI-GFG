# Classes

| Day | Topic | Description | Resources |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| **1** | Python Speedrun | Covered Python fundamentals: datatypes, operators, typecasting, conditions, loops, and data structures in a fast-track session. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LsRMCh101xmIPx3UMD77K6WhMutsOfQn?usp=sharing) |
| **2** | AI Roadmap & Glossary | AI vs ML vs DL roadmap, components of AI models, and essential AI glossary for beginners. | [Open Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=9WhtBPpxVLK81mpKHPFjr,WGVBOpuVyHum-zDyvcYajA) |
| **3** | Deep Learning Foundations | Neural networks working, artificial vs biological neuron, parameters in neural nets, and Iris dataset training with hyperparameter tuning. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L2v8bwRhh0o-EOAS-tTEnupO-2vA0ehD?usp=sharing) <br> [Open Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=zHWLPiw8jJabzepGoSAm0,BXy45NKSA_rMHCC3xpl24g) |
| **4** | Deep Learning → Generative AI & LLMs | Roadmap from Deep Learning to Generative AI, how LLMs are trained, decoding GPT models, pretraining, fine-tuning, and complete LLM pipeline explained visually. | [Open Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=CitXqx1uWGzfLPvnTiBnv,A43TWw8QyBK0DLNG7ipWCQ) |
| **5** | Generative AI Projects Day | Built 3 end-to-end projects: AI Content Writer, Bulk AI Content Creator, and AI Chatbot. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OtwvBrhic4FSQ5hu3W2ouejBRb9-QwfB?usp=sharing) |
| **6** | Open-Weight Models & HuggingFace | Worked with open-weight LLMs using HuggingFace. Model loading, inference, prompt-based generation, and interview-question dataset tagging. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tF3WZuJVskvSy9UKrPNPCP3-wnOd0YPq?usp=sharing) <br> [GitHub Dataset](https://github.com/AshishJangra27/datasets/tree/main/Intervew%20Questions) |
| **7** | LLMs Taking Actions & Text2SQL | Built DIY agents and implemented Text2SQL using Sneaker Sales dataset for natural language to SQL query conversion. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sfEoNvvEfN2w-tY32mryq_QIUtxA4EB6?usp=sharing) <br> [GitHub Dataset](https://github.com/AshishJangra27/datasets/tree/main/Sneaker%20Sales) |
| **8** | DIY RAG (From Scratch) | Built Retrieval-Augmented Generation without using LangChain or fancy libraries. Implemented embeddings, similarity search using NumPy, and LLM response pipeline manually. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NJ67hZiQ5NLCFj78CrAiKNbCNvdRlvaf?usp=sharing) |
| **9** | LLM-Based Web Search Agent | Built a web search system using Serper API where multiple webpages are fetched, summarized, reasoned upon, and final structured answer generated by LLM. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F1_TP5RTSfsYaMD_Qpg0K4LX4tIi-y0R?usp=sharing) |
